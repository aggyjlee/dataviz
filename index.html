        <h2>Hatecrime Increase During COVID-19 Pandemic</h2>
        <p>With the COVID-19 pandemic heightening hate speech and hate crimes across the globe, especially in Asian communities, social media flooded citizens with stories detailing personal hate crime experiences. However, these posts also depicted gaps in news coverage and FBI crime reports. The funnel below visualizes the gap between personal accounts, news coverage and reported crimes.  </p>

            <h2>Lifecycle of an Asian Hate Crime Story in 2021</h2>
            <p>After noticing the gap in media coverage, we conducted an in-depth analysis of the news cycle. Once a dataset of 7,000 hate crime stories was extracted from Google News, we narrowed down the stories in which Asians identities were in focus. Then, a sample set of 10 stories was analyzed for their length and coverage in the news cycle, and the results are shown below. </p>

        <h2>Headline Analysis of Atlanta Spa Shooting & Trial</h2>
        <p>In order to understand the syntax behind reported stories and their headlines, five publications were analyzed from local to national regarding the Atlanta spa shooting. Running each headline through a sentiment analysis tool, each headline received a composite score between -1 to 1. The closer to -1, the more negative the syntax and structure; the closer to +1, the more positive the syntax and structure. This analysis revealed a more narrow range than expected. Key words that lend itself to negative scores include death, shooting spree, killings, and suspect.</p>
